# Hibernate will automatically create/update the database schema based on entities
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
(Replace your_mysql_username and your_mysql_password)

Running the Application
Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and execute the Spring Boot run command using the Maven wrapper:

Bash

./mvnw spring-boot:run
This command will compile the project, update the database schema (if ddl-auto=update is set and changes are needed), and start the embedded Tomcat server.

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
